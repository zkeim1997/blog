<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Zach Keim, Cybersecurity Student</strong></h2>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>I am currently a Junior at Purdue University studying cybersecurity. I wish to have a<span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;career in the field of information 
security focused on defensive and counteractive measures against both simple and advance threats related to vulnerability mitigation, exploit patching, incident 
response, and policy management. From a young age I have always been fascinated by technology. I chose cybersecurity mainly because it encompasses all aspects of 
IT and is a constantly changing environment.&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p>I created this blog site as a place for me to document past and future projects and tutorials. In creating this website, I hope to gain a feel for what it is like 
to develop websites and to learn to use tools such as CSS and Jquery. Thank you for taking the time to learn a little about me and hope you enjoy my site.&nbsp;
</p>
